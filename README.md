# Password-Generator

# Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to create a password generator. Through prompts, the user can give what the criteria was for the password. Criteria included the length of the password and if it included lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

# What I Learned

## Javascript

Javascript can be very difficult and that I need to work on understanding the purpose of each code and how it can be utilised. I had a lot of trouble understanding the code given to me, and I was not sure what code to add to give the webpage the necessary function. Along with that, I allowed myself to procrastinate and be lazy. Those two combining factors contributed to the type of job I did on this assignment. In future homeworks and projects, I have to work on staying on top of things, understanding the purpose of the code, and asking for help at the right times.

# Description

## Prompts

The webpage is a simple layout of a header, container, subheader, textbox, and button. Once the user clicks on the button, a series of prompts will appear on the top asking the questions for each criteria. The questions come in this order: length of password, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
